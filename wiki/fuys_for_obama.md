# Fuys For OBAMA

**Fuys For OBAMA** was a game in development for the [Fuys](/fuys)[^fuys]' political campaign to be the new leader of [discord.gg/obama](https://discord.gg/obama). It featured various assets created by both PossiblyAxolotl, and the other Fuys.

## History

**Fuys For OBAMA** was a game in development by PossiblyAxolotl with the intent to boost votes for the Fuys[^fuys] in the discord.gg/obama election. The game begins with an AI generated version of Obama reading a speech claiming that *VonWin*, the main opponent of Fuys during the election, had captured him and was doing "unspeakable crimes" against him and the American people including arson on a small-town orphanage and creating more British people.

The Fuys' campaign was extremely successful, coming in at second place in the entire Obama election. AlexStyles was the representative of Fuys throughout the election and took part in varous activities while PossiblyAxolotl worked on the game proposed to bring in more voters. 

**Fuys For OBAMA** features various songs created by both CrimsonDestroyer, a Fuy[^fuys], and PossiblyAxolotl.

## Gameplay

The gameplay consisted of you controlling a shrimp with a gun, playing through various platformer levels in order to collect all of the MUG root beer and open the door to the next level.
